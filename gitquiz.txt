1. Enter the classroom.
2. Place your bag on a table and seat yourself at your usual workspace.
3. Turn on your computer and log in.
4. Clone your repository. Do this by typing in: git clone --config="http.proxy=http://your-network-username:your-network-password@192.168.2.1:8080" https://github.com/your-github-username/your-github-repository-name.git 
Then you fill in the missing information such as your network username and password.
5. Go under your repository folder by typing in: cd <insert repository name>
6. To create a new file, type in: gedit file.txt (always type a new, unique name to create a new file, since you don't just want to open an already existing file. The name file.txt is just an example)
7. Edit the file as you see fit.
8. Save the file (File --> Save). Then close the file. The asterisk in front of the file name disappears once the file is saved.
9. Make github acknowledge the file by typing: git add file.txt (always do git add <insert file name>)
10. Make a milestone by using commit. Type: git commit -m "insert comment here" (the comment should be unique and should relate to the changes made. An example would be "added file.txt")
11. To put the changes on github, type in: git push
12. Once the terminal asks you to, type in your github username and password.
13. Log out of your accounts and shut down the computer.
Grab your bag and exit the classroom :)
